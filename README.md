This is a classic snake written in Pascal.

You can launch the game via snakegame.exe.
You can view the code via snakegame.lpi in Lazarus IDE

I also added a couple of features:
- Increase the level and speed of the snake when collecting points
- Bonus food - appears for a limited time and gives more points
- Highscore system - saves the top 5 results in the `highscores` folder
